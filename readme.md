# Write Cleaner Code
Fork me and fix me.

## Productivity of clean code
You'll spend the majority of your development life reading code. There other part will be writing code that others read. Make it easy on us an follow the rules of clean code.

## Get Started
In each folder there are examples messy code. Some are simple. Just give it a shot and show you know how to write great code.

## Rules of Clean Code:
1. Use descriptive names. (variables, classes, functions)
1. Give each class/function one job to do.
1. Re-factor in ways to write less code.
1. Keep it readable, not clever.
1. Be consistent with your coding style.

You'll make a lot of employers and developers sooooo happy.

## Want to contribute?
Teach the work how to write cleaner code. Fork me and add more examples. Keep the examples quick. Each example should take more than 2-4 minutes to complete. One folder per coding language. No more than five examples (rules of clean code) per language.
